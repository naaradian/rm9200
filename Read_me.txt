119 070626	_44				remove init globals for rtcs to file rtcscmd.c stack_size is correct now!!!
120 070627	_45				any try making enet init. find hanging in _QUEUE_LINK. ping do not work. go back to version _43.
121 --		_46				maked from _43 changed files rtcscmd.c (added init global variables) and mqx_prv.h (comment nxt->prev =...). Very long time it was work from .bin
122 070628	_47				maked correctly removing nxt->prev from macros .._LINK  not work ping from .bin not start after long power off.
123 --		_48				remove two constants into void bsp_enable_card
124 --		_49				set nxt back in makros - if tasks use this macros it hangt. ping work about nxt - big ???
125 070629	_50				rtcs start from cold state!!!!! this point is start for make cold ping and enover changes. snmp and tftp are commented  queue is overlov tcpip not start
126 --		_51				start point to go for. tftp and snmp are coomented,  in rtce added init global veriables. need check start this from cold state, after this make ping. Now ping work from debugger!!! Not work from cold state.
127 --		_52				comment in hello.c all about rtcs.Mqx hier is start from cold state!!!  if add _51 sources -> this is working mqx!!!!!!!!!!!!!
128 --		_53				rtcs_create is start from cold!? maked lwsem_wait1 widch commented _sched_execute_scheduler_internal. if uncomment if bind if_add and gate_add and run from debugger - ping work! This is point "2" for next.
